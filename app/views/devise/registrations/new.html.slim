        p Your account expresses your voice and your personality here on Reddit. To protect that voice, you need to protect your access to it and maintain its security. Not only do compromised accounts deprive you of your online identity, but they are often used for malicious behavior like vote manipulation, spam, fraud, or even just posting content to misrepresent the true owner. While we’re always developing ways to take faster action against compromised accounts, there are things you can do to be proactive about your account’s security.
